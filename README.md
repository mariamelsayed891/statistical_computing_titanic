📊 Statistical Computing Project – Titanic Dataset (R)

📌 Overview

This repository contains our Statistical Computing course project, where we applied a complete data analysis workflow using R programming on the famous Titanic dataset.

The project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical inference, regression modeling, simulation, and an interactive dashboard using Shiny.

⸻

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
	•	Importing the Titanic dataset
	•	Cleaning column names
	•	Converting variable types
	•	Handling missing values:
	•	Filling missing Age with median
	•	Filling missing Embarked with mode
	•	Removing duplicates
	•	Data summary and structure overview

⸻

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Histogram of Age
	•	Scatter plot: Age vs Fare
	•	Survival comparison by Passenger Class
	•	Boxplot: Fare by Class
	•	Pie chart for Gender distribution
	•	Count plot: Survival by Gender
	•	Correlation heatmap

⸻

🔄 Data Manipulation (Tidyverse)
	•	Filtering female passengers in 3rd class
	•	Calculating survival rate by sex and class
	•	Extracting top 10 highest fares
	•	Creating family_size variable
	•	Summarizing survival based on family size

⸻

📐 Statistical Inference
	•	Chi-square test: Survival × Passenger Class
	•	t-test: Difference in age between survivors and non-survivors

⸻

📈 Modeling & Diagnostics
	•	Logistic Regression model to predict survival
	•	Interpretation of model coefficients
	•	Model diagnostics:
	•	Normal Q-Q plot of residuals

⸻

🔁 Simulation & Comparison
	•	Simulating new fare values using the fitted model
	•	Comparing real vs simulated data:
	•	Summary statistics
	•	Histogram comparison
	•	Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
	•	Predicting survival probabilities
	•	Simulating survival outcomes
	•	Comparing observed vs simulated survival
